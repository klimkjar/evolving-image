        <h3>What am I watching?</h3>
        <p>The above is a javascript program I wrote to illustrate the concept of evolution and mutations to my 7-year old son. The
          image on the right is a random process trying to evolve into the image on the left. It is inspired by
          <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">a project by Roger Alsing</a>. When the simulation starts the image will appear to be a rapidly changing blob of random colors, but as the process goes
          on it will more and more closely resemble the target image. After around 1000 generations the basic colours and shapes should
          start appearing, and after around 10 000 major features should be recognizable. Smaller details will take longer to appear.
          Leave the process running for a while, the longer it runs the better the result.</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The image is composed from up to 50 semitransparent polygons. You can picture them as pieces of differently colored cellophane
          paper stacked on top of each other. The simulation will randomly rearrange these pieces, adding or removing them, adjusting
          colors, or moving corners around. After every step the resulting picture is compared to the original, and assigned a "fitness
          score" depending on how well it matches. The more the picture resembles the original, the better the score. If the score
          is better than the best previously created image, it will be kept.</p>
        <h3>I'm not seeing anything!</h3>
        <p>This is a quick proof-of-concept, and might not work well in older or mobile browsers. It has been confirmed working in
          recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari, as well as on iPhone/iPad browsers. It is normal for the
          simulation to stall for a while on occasion, as long as the iterations in the statistics below are updating the process is
          running. The minimum accepted error threshold gradually increases to prevent the process from getting stuck in a local minimum.
          If things are going slowly in the early beginning, try refreshing the page for a different starting point which might work
          better.</p>
